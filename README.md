<h1>Project Title</h1>
<p>The DLSU Marketplace: A Centralized Platform for Pre-Loved Items within the Lasallian Community</p><br>
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>People at De La Salle University (students, teachers, staff) use several social media groups and message threads to buy and sell pre-loved items, ranging from academic to personal. This method is inefficient as listings for items are difficult to search by specific course needs, item conditions are unverified, and the nature of being an online group leads to “lost” listings and potential safety or scam concerns during meetups.</p><br>
